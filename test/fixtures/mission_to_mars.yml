unmanned_lander:
  id: 1
  type: MissionToMars::MissionType
  name: Unmanned lander
  description: This mission does not have the capability to move on the surface and will remain in one spot after landing.  By selecting this option, you have the most weight and budget available for detectors and other instruments.  You should select from four out of the five available options below for both the detectors and instruments.
  allowed_cost: 4
  duration: 180
  success_rate: .95
  sort_order: 1
      
unmanned_lander_with_rover:
  id: 2
  type: MissionToMars::MissionType
  name: Unmanned lander with rover
  description: This mission includes a rover that is able to move on the surface of Mars.  The rover will travel on wheels and can move up to 10 miles in any direction over the life of its mission.  By selecting this option, you have less weight and budget available for detectors and other instruments.  You should select from three out of the five available options below for both the detectors and instruments.

unmanned_lander_with_rover_and_return_ship:
  id: 3
  type: MissionToMars::MissionType
  name: Unmanned lander with rover and return ship
  description: This mission does not have the ability to move on the surface and will remain in one spot after landing.  It does have the ability to collect up to 20 kilograms of rock, soil and atmospheric samples from itâ€™s landing site, and includes rockets for launching and returning any collected samples back to Earth.  Due to the weight and cost of the return ship and fuel, you can only select from two out of the five available options below for both the detectors and instruments.
  allowed_cost: 2
  duration: 30
  success_rate: .80
  sort_order: 3
  
manned_mission:
  id: 4
  type: MissionToMars::MissionType
  name: Manned mission
  description: The manned mission to Mars includes a crew of six, a surface lander and the ability to return up to 10 kilograms of material from the surface.  Five out of the six crew members will be able to walk on the surface.  Due to the weight and cost of the required life support systems, food, return ship and fuel, you can only select one out of the five available options below for both the detectors and instruments.
  allowed_cost: 1

  description: A mass spectrometer measures the relative abundance of the constituent elements in gas molecules, either from the atmosphere or from the gas released from solid samples by heating them.  
  cost: 1
  sort_order: 1
  
laser:
  id: 6
  type: MissionToMars::Detector
  name: Lased induced spectrometer
  description: A laser spectrometer measures the light spectrum emitted after vaporizing solids or liquids with a laser, and is used to determine which constituent components are contained in the sample.
  cost: 1
  sort_order: 2

chem_lab:
  id: 7
  type: MissionToMars::Detector
  name: Chemical processing lab
  description: The chemical processing lab analyzes gas molecules to detect for signs of organic material or water vapor.
